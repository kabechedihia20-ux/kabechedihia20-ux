## Featured Project

### Credit Card Transaction Prediction API

🔗 Project repository: [https://github.com/kabechedihia20-ux/credit-card-transaction-prediction-api](https://github.com/kabechedihia20-ux/credit-card-transaction-prediction-api)

**Objectives**
Development of an end-to-end machine learning system designed to analyze structured transaction data and generate risk predictions through a Flask API, simulating a real-world financial fraud detection workflow.

**Modeling**
Several classification models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, in order to learn patterns in transaction behavior. Model performance was evaluated using a train/test split and standard metrics to select the most reliable predictor.

**Deployment**
The selected model was integrated into a Node.js REST API to allow real-time predictions. The system accepts transaction inputs and returns a prediction, demonstrating a simple and practical deployment scenario.
